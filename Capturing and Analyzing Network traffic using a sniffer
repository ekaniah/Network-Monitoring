# Lab Title: Network Monitoring

## Date: 05/31/2024

## Lab Overview:
Network Monitoring
Learn how to use Wireshark, a sniffer, to capture and analyze network traffic. 
Then, dive deeper into network analysis by learning how to perform packet analysis.

### Part 1 - Capturing and Analyzing Network traffic using a Sniffer

#### Time for Lab Completion:

Provide the time to complete the lab in “HRS, MIN” format, i.e. 1 hour, 10 minutes

#### Purpose of the Lab:
This lab teaches one how to:
Configure the network interface to allow a sniffer to capture packets.
Generate and capture traffic on the network.
Analyze captured traffic in Wireshark.
Capturing and analyzing network traffic using a sniffer is crucial to cybersecurity because sniffers
enable cybersecurity proffessionals to monitor activities on a network, gain valuable insight,and
detect potential threats such as malware, data breaches and unauthorized access.

#### What did you enjoy about the lab?
it was very short 

#### What did you find most challenging about the lab?
There were no challanges


Discussion Questions A
1.	What is a sniffer?
A sniffer is a tool that captures and analyzes network traffic.
2.	What is ifconfig?
The ifconfig is a command line tool in Linux that enumerates all the interfaces on a system
3.	What is the name of the sniffer used in this lab?
Wireshark

Discussion Questions B
1.	What is FTP?
File Transfer Protocol
FTP is a protocol that allows for transfer of files between systems and uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports 20 and 21.
2.	What is JPG?
JPG or JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Expert Group. It is a format for saving image files using lossy compression technique to reduce the file size.
3.	What is telnet?
TELNET or Teletype Network is a protocol that enables a local computer to connect to remote computer over TCP/IP network.
4.	What is net group?
Net group is a command-line tool built into Windows Vista1. It is used to add, expand, or delete groups by specifying the name of the group.
 The netgroup file, on the other hand, defines "netgroups", which are sets of (host, user, domain) tuples, used for permission checking when doing remote mounts, remote logins and remote shells.

Discussion Questions C
1.	What is POP?
POP stands for Post Office Protocol (POP). It is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server
2.	What is a .cap file?
A CAP file is a file format used for capturing and storing network traffic data. It contains packets and metadata collected by a packet sniffing program over a network transmission. CAP files are also called trace files or bone files, and they are used by network monitoring and analysis tools such as Wireshark, tcpdump, and Snort.
3.	What is a TCP stream?
A TCP stream is a sequence of packets exchanged between two devices typically, a server and  a client over a network connection.
